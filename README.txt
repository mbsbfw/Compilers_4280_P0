COMP_SCI_4280
Project: P0
BY: MICHAEL SAGO
Language: C

This project is done in the C programming language. This program builds a tree
and prints it out to different files using Pre-In-Post order traversals.

There will be three output files created; one for each traversal:
output.preorder
output.inorder
output.postorder

//To compile the program:
		>make 
//Then you have two options to run the program:
		1.
			>./P0 [filename]
		2.
			>./P0
/*
	If using option 2 you will then be able to enter diferent strings or 
	integers of your choice. I use a simulated end of file so you 
	should enter either eof or EOF on a line by itself to end your input and 
	the according trees will then be created and printed.
